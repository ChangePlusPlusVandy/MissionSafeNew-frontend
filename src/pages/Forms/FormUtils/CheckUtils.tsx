export const checkPolicy = `All check requests must have supporting documents, such as order forms, registration forms, invoices, contracts, W9 forms, if applicable, etc.\n
If the check needs to be mailed specifically to someoneâ€™s attention, then a pre-addressed envelope MUST be attached to paperwork.
Should a vendor require our Tax Exempt Certificate, please indicate that on check request.
All checks will be mailed out directly to the payee/vendor from the Accounts Payable Department. Any exceptions to this will need to be approved.
Honorarium requests need to be submitted with a contract or letter of agreement and a W9 Form along with the Check Request.
Services Rendered requests need to be submitted with a contract or invoice (detailing the services being performed) from the vendor, a W9 form, and check request.
Do not use this form if a Purchase Order has been written/processed. Submitting a check request with an invoice when there is an existing purchase order written will duplicate the request.`;
